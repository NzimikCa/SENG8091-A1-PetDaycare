# Assignment #1: Getting Organized – Pet Daycare Project
## 1. Requirements Breakdown

Based on the initial interview findings, we can summarize the issues as follows:

### Business Problems
- **Owners’ frustration**: Onboarding new employees takes at least 3 months, causing inefficiency and resource strain.  
- **Employees’ frustration**: The client onboarding process is overly complex, with each employee following their own variation of the workflow. This leads to inconsistency and wasted effort.  
- **Customers’ frustration**: The onboarding process is confusing and lacks clarity, leading to dissatisfaction, potential churn, and negative brand perception.

### Functional Requirements
#### Employee Onboarding
1. A standardized, step-by-step training process for new hires.  
2. Training modules (digital or physical) accessible to all employees.  
3. A tracking system to monitor onboarding progress and completion status.  
4. A mechanism for feedback from new employees to continuously improve training.  

#### Client Onboarding
1. A unified intake system (digital form or portal) for capturing client and pet information.  
2. Standardized workflow for processing new clients, ensuring employees follow the same procedure.  
3. Automation of repetitive tasks such as sending confirmation emails, generating contracts, or storing pet records.  
4. Role-based access control for employees handling sensitive client data.  

#### Customer Experience
1. A clear, user-friendly onboarding flow (digital-first, with alternatives for non-digital users).  
2. Simple navigation with clear instructions for pet owners.  
3. Self-service options such as uploading vaccination records, checking onboarding status, and accessing FAQs.  
4. Transparent communication at each stage (e.g., confirmation messages, progress updates).

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Usability**: The system should be intuitive for both employees and customers, with minimal training required.  
2. **Reliability**: High system availability to avoid disruptions in onboarding.  
3. **Scalability**: Ability to handle growing numbers of clients and employees as the business expands.  
4. **Security**: Compliance with data protection standards (e.g., secure storage of personal and pet health data).  
5. **Performance**: Quick load times and smooth navigation.  
6. **Maintainability**: Easy to update and modify processes as business needs evolve.  

---

### Implementation-Oriented Outcomes
The above requirements suggest the development of an **integrated onboarding solution** that:  
- Reduces employee onboarding time by at least 50%.  
- Ensures all employees follow a standardized client onboarding process.  
- Provides a consistent, easy-to-follow onboarding flow for customers.  
- Improves satisfaction for all three groups: owners, employees, and customers.

## 2. Assumptions & Validation Plan

### Assumptions
1. Employees currently use a mix of paper forms, email, and ad-hoc digital tools.  
2. Owners have not formally defined measurable KPIs but want to reduce onboarding time significantly.  
3. Customers prefer a digital-first process but some may require offline or assisted onboarding options.  
4. The business does not currently have a centralized onboarding platform or database.  
5. Training inconsistencies exist because employees are not given standardized resources.  
6. Clients may need to provide sensitive documents (e.g., vaccination records, medical information).  
7. There is budget and willingness to adopt new tools or systems.  

---

### Validation Plan (Assumption → Validation Action)
1. **Current tools used** → Ask employees to demonstrate their current onboarding process.  
2. **KPIs for success** → Confirm with owners what “reduced onboarding time” means in measurable terms.  
3. **Customer preference** → Survey or interview a small set of clients to validate digital vs. offline needs.  
4. **No centralized system** → Ask IT/admin staff if any software currently exists, and if so, evaluate its usage.  
5. **Training inconsistencies** → Request examples of employee onboarding documents or checklists.  
6. **Document handling** → Confirm legal/compliance requirements for collecting and storing sensitive information.  
7. **Budget and willingness** → Ask owners directly about budget range and openness to adopting new systems.

## 3. Questions for the Client

### Clarification Questions
1. What is the current workflow for employee onboarding (step by step)?  
2. What is the target timeframe to reduce onboarding from 3 months to what? (e.g., 1 month?)  
3. What tools are currently used to collect client information (paper, spreadsheets, software)?  
4. What information must be captured during client onboarding (pet health, owner contact, preferences)?  
5. Are there any legal or compliance requirements for data handling?  
6. Who will be the primary users of the new system (admins, employees, clients)?  
7. What are the most common client complaints about the current onboarding process?  
8. Do employees have company-provided devices or do they rely on personal laptops/phones?  
9. Is there a budget allocated for system implementation and employee training?  
10. Are seasonal spikes (holidays, summer) expected in client onboarding?  

---

### Possible Follow-Up Questions
- Should customers be able to track their onboarding progress online?  
- Do owners want analytics reports (e.g., average onboarding time, customer satisfaction metrics)?  
- Should the solution integrate with existing systems (e.g., payroll, scheduling, CRM)?  
- Is multi-language support required for diverse customers?  
- Would the business prefer a phased rollout (pilot test) or immediate company-wide adoption?
