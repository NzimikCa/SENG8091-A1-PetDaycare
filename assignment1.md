# Assignment #1: Getting Organized – Pet Daycare Project
## 1. Requirements Breakdown

Based on the initial interview findings, we can summarize the issues as follows:

### Business Problems
- **Owners’ frustration**: Onboarding new employees takes at least 3 months, causing inefficiency and resource strain.  
- **Employees’ frustration**: The client onboarding process is overly complex, with each employee following their own variation of the workflow. This leads to inconsistency and wasted effort.  
- **Customers’ frustration**: The onboarding process is confusing and lacks clarity, leading to dissatisfaction, potential churn, and negative brand perception.
